## Overview
**MaNo** is an efficient training-free approach grounded in theory that leverages logits to estimate the generalization performance of a pre-trained neural network under distribution shifts. It makes use of $\sigma$, a novel normalization function to deal with poorly-calibrated scenarios. Given a *pre-trained* model $f$ and a test set $D_{test} = (x_i)_{i=1}^N$ with K classes, **MaNo** operates as follows:
- Recover the logits $\theta_i = f(x_i)$
- Normalize the logits $\theta_i \to \sigma(\theta_i) \in \Delta_K$
- Fill a prediction matrix $P \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times K}$ with rows $\sigma(\theta_i)$
- Compute the estimation score $S(f, D_{test})$ as the scaled p-norm of $P$, i.e., $S(f, D_{test}) = \frac{1}{NK} \lVert P \rVert_p$.

## Results
We conduct large-scale experiments under several distribution shifts with ResNets, ConvNext, and ViT on various open-source benchmarks. 

ðŸ¥‡ **SOTA performance.** Our approach **MaNo** provides the best and most robust accuracy estimation.

ðŸš€ **Qualitative benefits.** Our approach is training-free, fast and memory efficient.
